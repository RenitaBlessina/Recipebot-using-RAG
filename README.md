## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Flask (`pip install flask`)  
- RapidFuzz (`pip install rapidfuzz`)  
- dotenv (`pip install python-dotenv`)
- openapi(`pip install openapi`)

### **Setup**
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git@github.com:RenitaBlessina/Recipebot-using-RAG.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Create and configure the `.env` file:
